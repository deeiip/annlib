======
annlib aims to create c++ library for designing neural network. Currently this project has a main file to test the functionality without unittest. The target is also
set to build a executable not a dll.
this project is under construction and this repo is for mutual collaboration.
This project uses cpu thread to handle brunched network and to calculate the result in each layer it uses C++AMP (optional)
